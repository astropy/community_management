# Community Management for Astropy

This repository will have all the work and code used in the community management work.
This includes community data, engagement tracking scripts, GitHub actions, and output data,
survey data, and reports that are currently ongoing and any other community work.

The community managers have been doing some work on engagement tracking and made good progress.

As the current community manager, Beryl Kanali will be responsible for keeping the repository up-to-date.
